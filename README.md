# Work Day Scheduler 

- The Work Day Scheduler is built using Jquery, Bootstrap, and moment.js to create a dynamic and responsive work day calender

- Upon opening the page the header will display the current date

- Ideally the text areas are color coded depending on the current time however I seem to be incapable of getting this to work :/

- Clicking the buttons on the right will save the data in the corresponding text area, upon reloading the page that data is retrieved from localStorage and brought onto the page

- If you can explain to me why the loading refuses to work in chrome but works in firefox that would be great :)
